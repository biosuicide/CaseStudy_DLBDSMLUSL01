# CaseStudy_DLBDSMLUSL01

This repository contains the full analysis and supporting materials for the case study “Mental Health in Technology-related Jobs”, submitted as part of the IU course DLBDSMLUSL01 – Machine Learning: Unsupervised Learning and Feature Engineering.

The project explores mental health in the IT sector using the OSMI Mental Health in Tech Survey (2016) dataset. 
It applies unsupervised machine learning methods such as t-SNE, PCA, Isomap, and DBSCAN, alongside statistical and text-mining techniques (TF–IDF, Bag-of-Words) to identify patterns in attitudes toward mental health disclosure and employer support.

The repository provides data preprocessing steps, model parameters, visualization scripts, and reproducible code used for the final analysis and figures presented in the report.

All scripts are written in Python 3.12 and the libraries noted in the requirements.txt.
